        <h4>AI based website navigation for educational purpose</h4>
        <p class="Para">In this project. I created a chatbot to be used by students to
          get queries responded easily from the college website. This
          chatbot provides a test-based user interface, allowing the
          user to type commands and receive as text. I have used
          python as programming language along with AIML(Artificial
          Intelligence Markup Language). This application saves time
          for students and teachers.</p>
